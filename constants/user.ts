      desc: "Technology Associate Programme (TAP), an exclusive two-year leadership-trainee initiative, I honed my technical and professional skills within the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Department (DSAID). My role encompassed the development of a cloud-based data privacy platform, leveraging React, Terraform, and AWS to enhance performance and security. I optimized cloud resource allocation on AWS, significantly reducing operational costs, while also designing and managing CI/CD pipelines using GitLab to streamline development workflows. In addition to maintaining on-premise analytics platforms, I contributed to data strategy planning and capability development at the Whole-of-Government (WOG) level. I led the implementation of cloud infrastructure for MLOps/AIOps, driving AI innovation across 30 government agencies and serving over 450 users. My multi-cloud approach, utilizing AWS and Azure, resulted in substantial cost savings. I played a pivotal role in spearheading Whole-of-Government GenAI adoption, which reduced time-to-market by 75% and enhanced productivity. Throughout my tenure, I supervised junior engineers, introduced structured code reviews, and advanced software engineering practices within the team. I also organized training workshops and led a hackathon that identified high-potential projects for future growth. My contributions extended to Singapore's National AI 2.0 Strategy, where I hosted AI events and fostered AI community building and innovation for the nation."
