I have been building things for a while: Failed startup ideas, AI platforms, data pipelines, random side projects that start as "one weekend" and somehow turn into weeks. But I almost never write down what I learned, which means the same lessons keep getting re-learned (and occasionally re-debugged).

So this blog is me fixing that.

Writing is also a good honesty test. If I cannot explain something simply, I probably don't understand it as well as I thought. And if I can explain it, future me (and maybe someone else) gets to benefit from it.

## How I'm publishing

This site is where I publish first.

After that, I'll repost to [Medium](https://medium.com/@tengfone) using their import tool so it points back here as the original source. Mostly because I want a home base on my own domain, but I also don't mind the extra reach.

My workflow is intentionally boring:

1. Write the post here (MDX)
2. Deploy
3. Import to Medium
4. Publish it public

## What I'll write about

Mostly the stuff I run into day to day: AI infrastructure, MLOps, full-stack engineering, and the occasional deep dive when I build something and it surprises me (in a good or bad way).

No fixed schedule. If there's something worth sharing, I'll write it.

Thanks for reading — more soon.
